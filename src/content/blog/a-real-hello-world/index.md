description: A retrospective of my time in the junior phase at Fullstack Academy.
---

I am currently in the review week between the junior and senior phases at
Fullstack Academy in Chicago. This seemed like as good of a time as any to get
a basic blog off the ground and reflect on what I have learned in the last six
weeks. I'll be talking big picture stuff here for someone who might be looking
into a bootcamp and I'll get into some more technical issues next time.

##Attitude
I can't help but think of the Henry Ford quote, "“Whether you think you can, or
you think you can’t – you’re right.” As a chronic self-doubter I have had to
battle my own thoughts about myself for basically my whole life. Once I started
this bootcamp I quickly learned that doubting myself was just not an option and
that I needed to develop a process for myself when I encountered a problem. The
solution to any particular issue might be reading documentation, posting about a
problem on slack overflow, asking for help, taking a walk to the kitchen, or even
commenting out everything related to my problem and starting from scratch. The
key is that the only way I wouldn't have been able to solve an issue is if I gave
up and decided that I wasn't capable of doing it.

Fullstack emphasizes the productive struggle. This is when you are trying to solve
a problem and still have ideas for how to move forward or what resources you might
be able to use. The productive struggle is great for me because this is when my
biggest breakthroughs in my understanding of our stack have happened.

##Pace
I got lots of great advice from the senior students as I was getting started. The
two which stick out the most were that anything I did outside of classroom hours
would help but also that I needed to give myself time each day to do something I
enjoyed that wasn't coding. Looking back I can say with confidence that hard work
and persistence do pay off in this program but you also need to give yourself a break.
I would have lost my mind if I didn't watch an episode of a Netflix show here and
there or taken a break to play tug of war with my dog.

I could write a book about all the things I learned in the past six weeks, both
technical and not, but I don't want to bore everyone with that. Reach out to me
on twitter @benjenkinsdev if you have question about what this experience is like
and I would be happy to offer an help I can!
